    "June explaining Lorentz transforms in a very fancy way. For some whole number $n$, GL($n$) is the group of the set of $n\\times n$ invertible square matrices together with matrix multiplication as the operation. In other words, $O(n)=\\{ M;MM^T=I\\}.$ However for a vector space $V$ we have GL($V$) = ${f;V\\to V;\\text{invertible}}.$ For instance, GL $(\\mathbb{R}^4)=\\{ M;\\text{det}\\neq0 \\}.$ We also have $O(3,1)=\\{ \\eta_{\\mu\\nu};M\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}M^T=\\eta_{\\mu\\nu} \\}$ where $\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the Minkowski spacetime metric, we have We also have  \n",
